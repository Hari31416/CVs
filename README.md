# My CVs/Resume and Cover Letters

This repository contains my CVs/Resume and Cover Letters. Usually, I tailor my CV for different positions and companies so the CVs you find here might not be the same CV that I use when I apply to the position.

There are two main folders here:

1. `general_cvs`: This will have the CVs I discussed above. These are here just for a reference.
2. `sample_cvs`: Here, I will add some CVs that I had created to apply for different positions. These CVs should be more specific to the position and the company.

> The goal of this repository is to let me showcase my CVs and Cover Letters to the world. It will also help me to keep track of the changes I make to my CVs and Cover Letters.
> I already have a private repository where I keep track of all my CVs and Cover Letters. This repository will be complementary to that repository.
